Project Description
================================

Developed an app for the site '<a href="http://www.rebuildyourcommunity.com/">Rebuild Your Community</a>' that allows users to report public works and infrastructure issues to the City of Toronto. The app allows users to submit a photo of an issue and identify their location using the Google Maps API. In addition, users can create an account and search for issues submitted by other users.
